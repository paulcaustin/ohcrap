# The Game of 10,000

This dice game is sometimes known as "Oh Shit" or just "Shits".
It has 2 or more players taking turns at throwing the dice to accumulate points.
When a player reaches 10,000, the other players get one more turn to try to beat
his score. The player with the highest score wins, and takes the pot.

## The Play

Each turn begins with the player rolling all six dice and ends when
the player fails to roll any scoring dice, thus "zeroing out", or
when he choose to not test his luck any further. Each roll must add
to the turn's score or the turn is over and the score for the turn
is zero. There may be several choices of which dice to keep after
a roll but, to continue rolling, you must keep one or more dice that
add to the turn's score. If you are able to keep all remaining dice,
and choose to, you may roll all six dice again and continue to
accumulate more points.

## The scoring

When a roll is made, these are the possible combinations of dice
that may be kept and their corresponding point value:

| Dice kept      | Point value |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Ace            | 100 |
| Five           | 50 |
| 3 of a kind    | 100 times face value |
| 4 of a kind    | 200 times face value |
| 5 of a kind    | 300 times face value |
| 6 of a kind    | 400 times face value |
| 3 Aces         | 1000 |
| 4 Aces         | 2000 |
| 5 Aces         | 3000 |
| 6 Aces         | 4000 |
| 3 pair         | 500 |
| 1,2,3,4,5,6    | 1500 |

Note that dice kept from one roll do not combine in any way with
dice from another roll. For this reason, the 3 pair, and the
straight are only possible when throwing all six dice and use all
six dice so that, if the player wants to continue, he will throw
all six dice again.

For example, here are all of the choices a player would have if
he was rolling six dice and got 1,2,2,2,4,5:

| Keeps      | Scores | Next Action |
|------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1,2,2,2,5  | 350    | Stop now and keep the 350 points. Next players turn. |
| 1,2,2,2,5  | 350    | Throws the one remaining die, risking a zero but possibly getting an ace or a five which adds to their score and allows them to continue by rolling all six dice again. |
| 1,2,2,2    | 300    | Roll two remaining dice, a fairly dangerous move |
| 5,2,2,2    | 250    | Roll two remaining dice, a dumb move |
| 2,2,2      | 200    | Roll three remaining dice |
| 1          | 100    | Roll five remaining dice, my personal choice |
| 5          | 50     | Roll five remaining dice, a dumb move |

## Complicating rules

At the beginning of the game, you are not allowed to stop unless you have 1000 points or more.

## The Money

Before beginning the game each player puts 25 cents in the pot. Everytime someone gets a zero (after they get the initial 1000 points) they must add a nickel to the pot. At the end, the player with the most points gets the pot.

## Variations

Of course, you can play this different ways.  Change the money rules.  Change the beginning rule.
Change the end-game rule. Change the scoring.  There are several varieties available on-line.
